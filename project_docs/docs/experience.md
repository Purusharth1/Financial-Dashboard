# ‚ú® Experience and Learnings

## üåü What Worked Well

* **Modular Codebase**: Separating concerns across `api`, `llm`, `ui`, and `tools` helped maintain clarity and scalability.
* **FastAPI Backend**: Enabled quick API development with excellent performance and easy integration with other modules.
* **LLM Layer**: Introducing a language model interface added an intuitive query mechanism for financial data exploration.

## üß© Challenges

* **Data Normalization**: Ensuring consistency across diverse financial datasets was complex and required iterative refinements.
* **UI Synchronization**: Keeping frontend components in sync with evolving backend schemas posed integration challenges.
* **Performance Testing**: Simulating realistic traffic with Locust demanded precise test scenarios and tuning.

## üí° What We Learned

* **Power of Abstraction**: Structuring services into micro-modules enhanced development speed and minimized bugs.
* **Natural Language Interfaces**: LLMs significantly improve accessibility in financial tools, but require prompt engineering finesse.
* **CI/CD Importance**: Early automation and testing pipelines are crucial for ensuring a robust and extensible platform.

## üîç Project Difficulty

This project was **moderately complex**, balancing system architecture, ML integration, and frontend-backend orchestration. The result is a solid foundation for a scalable financial analytics platform.
